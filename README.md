 Fertile or infertile? Male or Female?
The mordern poultry industry doesn’t have the answers to these questions so they’re forced to waste 9 billion infertile eggs and kill over 7 billion 1-day-old male chicks on a yearly basis.
Orbem, a spin-off from the Technical University of Munich and headquartered in Munich, is imagining new frontiers every single day to build a sustainable and healthy future.Founded on extensive scientific research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and imaging technology, this company has its roots deeply embedded in years of innovative exploration.
 In this article, we will delve into the critical aspects of Orbem's mission and initiatives, exploring how they are spearheading innovative solutions to address the pressing challenges of the global food crisis.

Orbem is dedicated to constructing cutting-edge, AI-powered imaging solutions designed to address some of the most challenging global issues. They specialize in generating innovative insights through their technology, empowering businesses to effectively tackle intricate problems. One of their pioneering solutions, the Orbem Genus, merges Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Deep Learning. This innovative approach allows for the development of a rapid, cost-effective, and widely accessible MRI system designed for the classification of chicken eggs before they hatch. In the realm of poultry, Orbem's technology has the potential to introduce billions of eggs into the food market, eliminate the unnecessary culling of billions of 1-day-old chicks, and concurrently establish new revenue streams.

The industry, as a whole, faces inefficiencies and underutilization of resources due to the inability to gain insights beneath the surface of products, processes, and data. The integration of imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging, with artificial intelligence is a key strategy employed to overcome these challenges. This approach enables the generation of novel insights and offers solutions to the most complex problems faced by customers. The primary product developed in this context focuses on the classification of chicken eggs before hatching. By doing so, billions of eggs that would otherwise go to waste are repurposed for use as food, showcasing a commitment to sustainability and resource optimization.
The organization is actively engaged in mitigating waste and minimizing energy consumption through the early detection of faults. Within the seed breeding industry, their advanced techniques allow for the early identification of viable seeds, resulting in a substantial reduction of up to 90% in energy intake per viable plant. This strategic initiative not only optimizes resource utilization but also demonstrates the organization's dedication to sustainable practices, promoting efficiency and productivity in the realm of agriculture
In response to assertions that the approach is not groundbreaking, it is acknowledged that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indeed not a new technology. The familiarity of many individuals with MRIs in hospital settings attests to the technology's potential. However, the prevailing limitation lies in its high cost, predominantly restricting its use to clinical applications.

The organization utilizes artificial intelligence to develop affordable, rapid, and adaptable MRI solutions. By shifting the focus from generating images for human interpretation to producing data for algorithms, the approach broadens the scope for various applications. An illustrative example is its implementation in the poultry industry.
