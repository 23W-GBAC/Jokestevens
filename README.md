# About My Main Blog â€“ Why I chose the Topic "Tech's Healing Touch: Poineering Companies Addressing Global Food Security and Healthcare Through the Power of AI"

I got really interested in the topic "Tech's Healing Touch: Pioneering Companies Addressing Global Food Security and Healthcare Through the Power of AI" after hearing about Orbem AI's cool research during a lecture. They use fancy MRI tech to figure out the gender of eggs, which I found pretty awesome. That got me curious, and I ended up digging into what other companies are doing with AI.

As a health informatics student, this topic is super important to me. It's not just about cool tech; it's about how it's changing the way we deal with big global problems. AI, healthcare, and food security are all coming together in a big way, and I'm excited to learn about all the different ways tech is making a difference.

Orbem AI's work is just a small part of a bigger story where AI is helping out in healthcare and food. AI isn't just for doctors; it's also helping farmers grow food better.

In this journey, I want to explore different companies and what they're doing. From using AI for health check-ups to making farming smarter, these companies show how tech can make our lives better. It's not just about doctors helping us stay healthy; it's also about having enough good food for everyone.

This isn't just a study project for me; it feels personal. I want to understand how AI can make a real difference in health and food, not just in theory but in the real world. Learning about these companies is like stepping into the future, where tech isn't just a cool idea but something that can change how we live for the better.
